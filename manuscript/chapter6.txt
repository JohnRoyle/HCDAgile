# Chapter 6 - HCDAgile at Scale

Explain how HCDAgile will work with most if not all scaling frameworks and also provide a point of view that to scale effectively that a blend of techniques are needed.

## 6.1 Story Sizing / Estimation

(Deterministic overview, delivery enablement spreadsheet)Include Estimation deck content regarding how to normalize and estimate epics to get a sense for overall scope. I can also include research on No-Estimate approaches to sizing and deterministic agile.https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18flWZh3s6pvX2al_iMsH59Tvzn_EEVP2AAvQVslV1fI/edit#slide=id.g4a6c7aef84_0_84

## 6.2 Scaling considerations

## 6.3 Defining Goals and Success Metrics 

## 6.4 Design / Vision - Shared across teams 

(Design vision needs to be carried thru the entire project scope and not just a single team)

## 6.5 Architecture - Isolate dependencies between teams 

(Use Interfaces and loose coupling for shared or dependent elements between teams.)

## 6.6 Implement a scaling framework

(Choose the lightest weight framework possible to ensure project control and alignment - SAFe,LeSS, SoS, Etc...)

## 6.7 Implement / Integrate DevOps Components

 (Use CI/CD and automated testing to ensure a clean integration path across teams.)
