- Lyssa Adkins](http://www.coachingagileteams.com/) The coaches’ coach. A certified scrum trainer who wrote a best-selling book **Coaching Agile Teams**. Possibly a surprise entry for some, but with a popular blog, strong book sales and internet searches. Lyssa Adkins makes the list.17.

He wrote **Adaptive Software Development** in 1999 where he used mountain climbing to illustrate his points about teamwork, planning and adaption.15. 
- [Roman Pichler](http://www.romanpichler.com/) A surprise entrant, but his focus on the **Product Owner** has increased his influence in the community. With the leading book on the subject and an increasingly popular blog. Roman Pichler makes our list.14. 
-  [Alistair Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/) Alistair helped write the Agile Manifesto and the **Agile Declaration of Interdependence**. He invented a set of methods called Crystal and has recently set up the ICAgile Certification. Despite limited success in this space, he continues to be influential within the Agile community.12. 
- [Scott Ambler](http://www.ambysoft.com/) The face of Agile IBM.

- [Kent Beck](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/Kent Beck.htm) There are those who will be very critical of Kent Beck’s position.

- [Mike Cohn](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/)Well, somebody has to be number one.

In almost every category, Mike Cohn’s name appeared in the top 10, and almost always in first or second position. Congratulations Mike.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature DemosThe Methods of Measurement in the last column are illustrations of the Gilb Measurability Principle: “anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to NOT measuring it at all.” In other words, a measurement does not have to be perfect or even very precise, as long as your intent is to get a quantitative handle on something that was previously purely qualitative; the important thing is to take that first step toward quantifying.
