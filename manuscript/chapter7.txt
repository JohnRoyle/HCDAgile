# Chapter 7 - Being Agile

Hopefully this book provides a solid foundation and insights for business and teams to build more effective solutions.  It is also the case that “being agile” will always remain more important than the process details.

With that in mind, I would encourage everyone to adapt and share their insights into other mechanisms and techniques that have led to great solutions. As an open source process I hope you will share your stories with everyone by visiting HCDAgile.com and sharing your story with us. 

** also note that being Agile in an HCDAgile system means looking for opportunities to apply HCDAgile to non traditional projects like data only projects or non IT projects.
